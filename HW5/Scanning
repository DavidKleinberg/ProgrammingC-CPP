For those that are still having an issue with reading in from the catalog, the scanf family of functions have some helpful modifiers to read in more specific cases.
 
* can be used to ignore input of a specified type.
For example if:
char name[10];
scanf("%d %*c %s", &x, name);
printf("%d %s", x, name);
 
is given input:
5yBob
 
It will output:
5 Bob
 
 
A number can be used to specify the number of a certain type to receive. For example:
 
char name [6];
scanf("%6c", name);
printf("%s", name);
 
When given the input:
John Smith
 
Will output:
John S
 
A character can be specified to signal scanf to stop reading by using the syntax [^(character)] following the % modifier. For example:
 
char name [10];
scanf("%[^,]", name);
printf("%s", name);
 
When given the input:
Smith, John
 
Will output:
Smith
 
These different modifiers can be combined into a variety of combinations to fine tune what scanf is inputting into variables. For example:
char name [15];
scanf("%15[^.]c", name);
printf("%s", name);
 
When given the input:
Smith, John Dr.
 
Will output:
Smith, John Dr
 
And when given input:
Button, Benjamin Mr.
 
Will output:
Button, Benjami
 
 
Hope this helps!
